# Revenue expense
Revenue is a temporary expense used in the current period or usually within one year. Profit costs include costs required to meet the ongoing operating costs of doing business, and thus are essentially the same as operating costs (OPEX).

Profit costs also include the general cost of repairs and maintenance required to keep the asset in good working order without significantly improving or extending the useful life of the asset. Cost of costs associated with existing assets includes regular repairs and maintenance as well as the cost of repainting and renovating. Cost of income can be considered as an ongoing cost as opposed to one type of capital expenditure.
