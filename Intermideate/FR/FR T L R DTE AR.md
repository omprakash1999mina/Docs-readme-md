# Debt to equity/asset ratio
Debt-to-equity ratio (D / E) is used to assess a company's financial viability and is calculated by dividing the company's total debt equally by shareholders. The D / E rating is an important metaphor used in business finance. It is a measure of the extent to which a company finances its performance on credit compared to fully managed funds. Clearly, it demonstrates the equity potential of shareholders to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. A credit-to-equity ratio is a type of gear ratio.

Debt/Equity = Total liabilities/Total Shareholders’ Equity
