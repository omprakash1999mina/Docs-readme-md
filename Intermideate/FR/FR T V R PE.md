# Price to earnings ratio (P/E)
A wage-to-earnings ratio (P / E rate) is a measure of a company that measures its current share value relative to its per share per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is sometimes known as the recurring price or double profitability.
P / E ratings are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's stock in a comparison of apples and apples. It may also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to comprise the combined markets against each other or over time.

P/E Ratio=Market value per share/Earnings per share
