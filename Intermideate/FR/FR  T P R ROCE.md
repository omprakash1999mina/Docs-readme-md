# Return on capital employed(ROCE)
Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial measure that can be used to assess a company's profitability and financial performance. In other words, this measure can help to understand how well a company makes a profit with its capital as it is used.
ROCE can be particularly useful when comparing corporate performance in high-cost sectors, such as services and communications. This is because, unlike other basics such as return on equity (ROE), which only analyzes the company's equity equity, ROCE considers debt and equity. This can help reduce the risk of financial misconduct in large debt companies.

ROCE= EBIT /Capital Employed

**where:**

EBIT=Earnings before interest and tax

Capital  Employed=Total assets − Current liabilities
