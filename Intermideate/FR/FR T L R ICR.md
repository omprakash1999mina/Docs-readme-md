# Interest coverage ratio
Interest rate is the amount of debt and interest used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt. The interest rate is calculated by dividing the company's pre-interest profits and taxes (EBIT) into its interest costs over a period of time.
The "cover" in the interest rate represents the length of time — usually quarterly or financial years — in which interest payments can be made with the company 's current income. In simple terms, it represents how often a company can pay its obligations using its salary.

Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT /Interest Expense
