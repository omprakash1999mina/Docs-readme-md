# Profit after tax
Profit After Tax means the amount remaining after the company has paid all its operating costs and non-operating expenses, other liabilities and taxes. This benefit is the one that the company distributes to its shareholders as dividends or retains it as a retained profit.
Profit After Tax is an important measure of a company, as it reflects the actual amount a company makes in that year of operation. It reflects the costs and revenue of the company, which in turn determines the efficiency and effectiveness.
