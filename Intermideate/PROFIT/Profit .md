# Profit
Profit is the amount from which a business is deducted after calculating all costs. Whether it is a lemonade site or an international trading company, the main goal of any business is to make money, so business operations are based on profits, in its various forms.

Some analysts are interested in higher profits, while others are more interested in making a profit before taxes and other expenses. Still others worry about profits only after all the expenses have been paid.
